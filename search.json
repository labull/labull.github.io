Focussing on monitoring techniques for telemetry data from systems and infrastructure.\nI’m particularly interested in multilevel structures that appear in measurements from interconnected populations of systems – trains, planes, automobiles (… wind turbines). By encoding domain expertise in a Bayesian workflow, complex models can be built from interpretable units, allowing machines to share information and increase the value of data. At the population level, alternative insights can emerge that might otherwise be missed – the whole is something besides its parts.\nI’m a communications editor for the Data-Centric Engineering journal (Cambridge University Press) and a member of the Early-Career Academic and Professionals Panel (ECAPP) in the Cambridge Centre for Smart Infrastructure and Construction (CSIC)."
